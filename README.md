# UFOs

## Overview

The purpose of this assignment was to update our UFO sightings websites to allow users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. While the original page only allowed you to filter on date, the new page also allows filters on city, state, country and shape.

## Results

To use the new webpage, a user can filter the UFO sightings data based on date, city, state, country and shape. All a user must do is enter a new search criterion in the corresponding search bar. For example, a user can find all UFO sightings that took place in California by typing “ca” into the “Enter State” search bar. The site is case-sensitive, so the search you type must exactly match what you are looking for. As you can see below, cy typing "ca" in the state search bar, you will filter the data to only see UFO sightings from California.

## Summary

One drawback of the webpage is that the search function is case sensitive. I understand this is a JavaScript limitation, so I would add a note near the search functions to let the site visitor know about this limitation. My two recommendations for further development would be to add back the filter button, and use that as the “event” for filtering the table. I personally think having the button makes the user experience a little bit better. I would also add an additional function that adds all the data back when the search bars are cleared – right now you have to refresh the page to get it back.
